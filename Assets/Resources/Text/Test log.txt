First test Results:

First Level:
2 total deaths in first level: 
All In First room (Move the turret to be more of a visible threat)

Completion time of an average = 85.36 seconds Little shorter than expected

Second Level:
14 total deaths in second level:
3 In first Area (All on right side after exiting spawn)
7 in Second Area (One due to fall damage, Reduce regular enemy amount)
4 in Final Area (Make balcony solid)

Completion time of an average = 136.33 seconds


Second test Results:

First Level:
No total deaths in first level: 

Pickups obviously spawning off of defeated enemies way too much, none touched in boss room, shotgun not sign posted enough?

Completion time of an average = 85.36 seconds Little shorter than expected

Second Level:
No Deaths

Pickups obviously spawning off of defeated enemies way too much, none touched in boss room

Completion time of an average = 136.33 seconds

Third Level:
Only 1 Death in the first room


Pickups obviously spawning off of defeated enemies way too much, almost none of the pre placed pick ups in boss room

Completion time of an average =


Third test Results:

One total deaths in first level: First room

Hit a nice balance on the drops here

Completion time of an average = 85.36 seconds Little shorter than expected

Second Level:
6 Deaths in total: 2 in each encounter (Seems about right)

Hit a nice balance on the drops here, though still few are touched in boss room

Completion time of an average = 136.33 seconds

Third Level:
Only 2 Deaths: 1 in the first room, One in the Courtyard (Again Just about right)


With the better balance and less drops we can maybe turn off the garaunteed drops from the turrets

Completion time of an average =
